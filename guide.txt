Sure! Here's a breakdown of the common Git commands and what they do:

1. **`git add`**: This command stages changes in your working directory. It tells Git which files or updates you want to include in the next commit. Think of it like selecting items to put into your shopping cart.

   Example:  
   ```bash
   git add filename.txt
   git add .
   ```

2. **`git commit`**: Once changes are staged using `git add`, the `git commit` command saves those changes to your local repository. It's like checking out your shopping cartâ€”you finalize your selection with a message describing what you've done.

   Example:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added a new feature to the app"
   ```

3. **`git push`**: This command uploads (or pushes) your committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub). It's how you share your updates with others.

   Example:  
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **`git pull`**: The `git pull` command fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into your local repository. It's like downloading the latest updates others have made.

   Example:  
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

5. **`git fetch`**: This retrieves changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch. It's like checking for updates but not installing them yet.

   Example:  
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

6. **`git status`**: A helpful command that shows the state of your working directory, staged changes, and untracked files.

   Example:  
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
